NAME
    Class::Factory::Enhanced - More functionality for Class::Factory

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Factory;
        use base 'Class::Factory::Enhanced';

        package Some::Class;
        My::Factory->add_factory_type(
            person_name    => 'Person::Name',
            person_address => 'Person::Address'
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This class subclasses Class::Factory and adds some functionality.

METHODS
    This class overrides and adds the following methods.

    "add_factory_type"
        Like "Class::Factory"'s "add_factory_type()", but this one can add
        several mappings at once. See the Synopsis for an example.

    "register_factory_type"
        Like "Class::Factory"'s "register_factory_type()", but this one can
        add several mappings at once.

    "make_object_for_type"
            $factory->make_object_for_type('person_name',
                last_name  => 'Shindou',
                first_name => 'Hikaru',
            );

        An alternative constructor that gets the class to be constructed
        from the factory, then calls "new()" on that class.

        Takes as arguments the object type to be constructed and a list of
        arguments to be passed to the constructor ("new()") of the newly
        constructed object.
