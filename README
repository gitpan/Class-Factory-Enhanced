NAME
    Class::Factory::Enhanced - More functionality for Class::Factory

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Factory;
        use base 'Class::Factory::Enhanced';

        package Some::Class;
        My::Factory->add_factory_type(
            person_name    => 'Person::Name',
            person_address => 'Person::Address'
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This class subclasses Class::Factory and adds some functionality.

METHODS
  add_factory_type
    Like "Class::Factory"'s "add_factory_type()", but this one can add
    several mappings at once. See the Synopsis for an example.

  register_factory_type
    Like "Class::Factory"'s "register_factory_type()", but this one can add
    several mappings at once.

  make_object_for_type
        $factory->make_object_for_type('person_name',
            last_name  => 'Shindou',
            first_name => 'Hikaru',
        );

    An alternative constructor that gets the class to be constructed from
    the factory, then calls "new()" on that class.

    Takes as arguments the object type to be constructed and a list of
    arguments to be passed to the constructor ("new()") of the newly
    constructed object.
